<h2>Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</h2>
<h3>In 1999 the Web Accessibility Initiative, a project by the World Wide Web<br />Consortium (W3C), published the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG 1.0.<br />On 11 December 2008, the WAI released the WCAG 2.0 as a Recommendation. WCAG<br />2.0 aims to be up to date and more technology neutral. Though web designers can choose<br />either standard to follow, the WCAG 2.0 have been widely accepted as the definitive<br />guidelines on how to create accessible websites. Governments are steadily adopting the<br />WCAG 2.0 as the accessibility standard for their own websites.</h3>

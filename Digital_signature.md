<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">What is digital signature?</span></span></h3>
<p>A digital signature is exactly what it sounds like a modern alternative to signing documents with paper and pen.</p>
<p>It uses an advanced mathematical technique to check the authenticity and integrity of digital messages and documents. It guarantees that the contents of a message are not altered in transit and helps us overcome the problem of impersonation and tampering in digital communications.</p>
<p>Digital signatures also provide additional information such as the origin of the message, status, and consent by the signer.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">The role of digital signature</span></span></h3>
<p>In many regions, including parts of North America, the European Union, and APAC, digital signatures are considered legally binding and hold the same value as traditional document signatures.</p>
<p>In addition to digital document signing, they are also used for financial transactions, email service providers, and software distribution, areas where the authenticity and integrity of digital communications are crucial.</p>
<p>Industry-standard technology called public key infrastructure ensures a digital signature's data authenticity and integrity.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">How do digital signatures work?</span></span></h3>
<p>Using a mathematical algorithm, digital signing solution providers such as Zoho Sign will generate two keys: a public key and a private key. When a signer digitally signs a document, a cryptographic hash is generated for the document.</p>
<p>That cryptographic hash is then encrypted using the sender's private key, which is stored in a secure HSM box. It is then appended to the document and sent to the recipients along with the sender's public key.</p>
<p>The recipient can decrypt the encrypted hash with the sender's public key certificate. A cryptographic hash is again generated on the recipient's end.</p>
<p>Both cryptographic hashes are compared to check its authenticity. If they match, the document hasn't been tampered with and is considered valid.</p>

Digital signatures are a legal way to electronically secure your approval on a document, contract, application or set of documents. Digital signatures can replace your handwritten signature to speed up virtually any paper-driven, manual signature processes.

Digital signatures are more secure as they provide an extra level of security by encrypting the signature and verifying the identity of the person signing.  

DocuSign eSignature is the world’s #1 way to send and sign documents.  Use it to do business faster and optimize efficiencies.  DocuSign eSignature handles the most demanding customer requirements, delivering an experience simple enough for practically anyone to adopt.

<ul>
<li>Upload your document&nbsp;into the electronic signature application, such as our DocuSign eSignature application.</li>
<li>Drag in the signature, text and date fields where the recipient needs to take action.</li>
<li>Click send. The electronic signature application will email a link to the recipient so they can access the document and sign.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re the recipient--or signer--you execute your signature in five simple steps with&nbsp;DocuSign eSignature:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Open the email&nbsp;with a request to digitally sign your document.</li>
<li>Click the link. Your document should open in an electronic signature tool such as our&nbsp;DocuSign eSignature&nbsp;application.</li>
<li>Agree to electronic signing. You may be asked to agree to sign. After confirming agreement and if the document was sent via&nbsp;DocuSign eSignature, you should see tags with instructions to Start or Sign.</li>
<li>Click each tag&nbsp;and follow the instructions to add your electronic signature where required to sign or initial.</li>
<li>Verify your identity&nbsp;and follow the instructions to adopt your electronic signature.</li>
</ul>

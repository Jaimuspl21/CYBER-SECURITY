<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Malware</span></h2>
<p>- Malware, short for <em>malicious software,</em> is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. We are going to explain these types of malware. It is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network." In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Virus</span></span></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>- A&nbsp;computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code. In the process, a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data.<p><strong>The signs of a computer virus are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequent pop-up windows.</strong>&nbsp;Pop-ups might encourage you to visit unusual sites. Or they might prod you to download antivirus or other software programs.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to your homepage.</strong>&nbsp;Your usual homepage may change to another website, for instance. Plus, you may be unable to reset it.</li>
<li><strong>Mass emails being sent from your email account.</strong>&nbsp;A criminal may take control of your account or send emails in your name from another infected computer.</li>
<li><strong>Frequent crashes.</strong>&nbsp;A virus can inflict major damage on your hard drive. This may cause your device to freeze or crash. It may also prevent your device from coming back on.</li>
<li><strong>Unusually slow computer performance.</strong>&nbsp;A sudden change of processing speed could signal that your computer has a virus.</li>
<li><strong>Unknown programs that start up when you turn on your computer.</strong>&nbsp;You may become aware of the unfamiliar program when you start your computer. Or you might notice it by checking your computer&rsquo;s list of active applications.</li>
<li><strong>Unusual activities like password changes.</strong>&nbsp;This could prevent you from logging into your computer.</li>
</ul></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;">Worm</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage.

Worms can be transmitted via software vulnerabilities. Or computer worms could arrive as attachments in spam emails or instant messages (IMs). Once opened, these files could provide a link to a malicious website or automatically download the computer worm. Once it’s installed, the worm silently goes to work and infects the machine without the user’s knowledge.

Worms can modify and delete files, and they can even inject additional malicious software onto a computer. Sometimes a computer worm’s purpose is only to make copies of itself over and over — depleting system resources, such as hard drive space or bandwidth, by overloading a shared network. In addition to wreaking havoc on a computer’s resources, worms can also steal data, install a backdoor, and allow a hacker to gain control over a computer and its system settings
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;">Trojan</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems. Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trojans are classified according to the type of actions that they can perform on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Backdoor&nbsp;</strong><br />A backdoor Trojan gives malicious users remote control over the infected computer. They enable the author to do anything they wish on the infected computer &ndash; including sending, receiving, launching and deleting files, displaying data and rebooting the computer. Backdoor Trojans are often used to unite a group of victim computers to form a botnet or zombie network that can be used for criminal purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploit&nbsp;</strong><br />Exploits are programs that contain data or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability within application software that&rsquo;s running on your computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rootkit&nbsp;</strong><br />Rootkits are designed to conceal certain objects or activities in your system. Often their main purpose is to prevent malicious programs being detected &ndash; in order to extend the period in which programs can run on an infected computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-Banker&nbsp;</strong><br />Trojan-Banker programs are designed to steal your account data for online banking systems, e-payment systems and credit or debit cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-DDoS&nbsp;</strong><br />These programs conduct DoS (Denial of Service) attacks against a targeted web address. By sending multiple requests &ndash; from your computer and several other infected computers &ndash; the attack can overwhelm the target address&hellip; leading to a denial of service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-Downloader</strong>&nbsp;<br />Trojan-Downloaders can download and install new versions of malicious programs onto your computer &ndash; including Trojans and adware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-Dropper</strong>&nbsp;<br />These programs are used by hackers in order to install Trojans and / or viruses &ndash; or to prevent the detection of malicious programs. Not all antivirus programs are capable of scanning all of the components inside this type of Trojan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-FakeAV</strong>&nbsp;<br />Trojan-FakeAV programs simulate the activity of antivirus software. They are designed to extort money from you &ndash; in return for the detection and removal of threats&hellip; even though the threats that they report are actually non-existent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-GameThief&nbsp;</strong><br />This type of program steals user account information from online gamers.</p>
</li>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Spyware</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="rich-text-editor parbase section">
<p>Spyware is unwanted software that infiltrates your computing device, stealing your internet usage data and sensitive information. Spyware is classified as a type of malware &mdash; malicious software designed to gain access to or damage your computer, often without your knowledge. Spyware gathers your personal information and relays it to advertisers, data firms, or external users.</p>
</div>
<div class="rich-text-editor parbase section">
<p>Spyware is used for many purposes. Usually it aims to track and sell your internet usage data, capture your credit card or bank account information, or steal your personal identity. How? Spyware monitors your internet activity, tracking your login and password information, and spying on your sensitive information.</p>
<p>Some types of spyware can install additional software and change the settings on your device, so it&rsquo;s important to use secure passwords and keep your devices updated.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Types of hardware</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>1. RAM</h4>
<p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer hardware that is used to store the information and then process that information. The processing speed of RAM is much faster than a hard disk but Ram is a volatile device which means when a computer system is shut down all the information stored is wiped out from RAM whereas hard disk is non-volatile which means it stores the data permanently in it. The data can be easily stored in RAM and can be easily fetched from RAM. The fetch process of data is very fast in Ram compare to hard disk. There are two types of RAM SRAM (Static Random Access Memory) and DRAM (Dynamic random access memory). The use of SRAM is in a cache memory of CPU. And the DRAM is mostly used in modern computers.</p>
<h4>2. Hard disk</h4>
<p>The hard disk is another type of computer hardware that is used to store the data in it. The hard disk can be preinstalled in CPU or can be used as an external device. The hard disk is the non-volatile component which means the data is stored permanently in hard disk and it does not wipe out when the system is shut down. The hard disk contains electromagnet surface which is used to store huge chunks of data and can be accessed easily. The hard disk has the capacity to store trillions of bytes of data in its storage. In the internal of hard disk, it has a collection of stacked disks which have electromagnetic surface used to store data in it. Every hard disk has a certain processing speed which varies from 4200-15000 rpm. The higher the rpm more is the processing speed of a hard disk. The high processing speed is used in supercomputers.</p>
<h4>3. Monitor</h4>
<p>For the computer hardware, the hardware is another device that is used to display the output, videos and other graphics as it is directly connected to the CPU. The video displayed by the monitor uses the video card. The monitor can be compared to the television set but the difference is the resolution and graphics displayed by the monitor are of much high quality compare to the television set. The desktop is connected via a cable and gets fitted in a computer video card which is installed in the motherboard of the computer system. For laptops, tablets the monitor is pre-built in the system and there is no separate hardware installed in these devices. There are two types of computer monitors which are CRT and LCD. The CRT was used as an old model of computers. The LCD is used in a modern computer as they are thinner and lighter and easy to use compared to CRT monitors.</p>
<h4>4. CPU</h4>
<p>CPU (Central processing unit) is the core hardware part of the computer system which is used to interpret and execute most of the commands using other computer parts i.e. software and hardware.&nbsp; The CPU is a core part of any PC, laptops, tablets, and notebooks. The CPU is also called the brain of the computer as every operation is executed in the CPU only. The CPU is made of computer chip which contains billions of small transistors installed on it. All the calculations are performed inside these transistors. The other hardware components which are monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, sound system are connected o CPU.</p>
<h4>5. Mouse</h4>
<p>It is a hand operator input device that is used to point something on the screen. The mouse can be wired or wireless. If the mouse is wired it is connected to the CPU directly. The mouse can uses the laser o ball to scroll up or down on the screen. Any movement done from the mouse sends instructions directly to the computer to move the cursor on the screen.</p>
<h4>6. Keyboard</h4>
<p>The keyboard is another type of computer hardware that is used to give input text, commands to the computer. The keyboard can be wired or wireless. The keyboard contains, alphabets, numbers, <a href="https://textfancy.com/characters/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">special characters</a> and other buttons to give input to the computer. It is the input device that takes input to the user and processes the commands.</p>
<h4>7. Printer</h4>
<p>The printer is a type of hardware that is used to print something which is seen on the computer and then transfer that displayed information to paper. The printers can be differentiated based on size, processing speed, and other factors.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Types of software</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
 <p>There are many different types of Internet security software out there, and it can be a dizzying industry to a newcomer. New customers ask themselves, &ldquo;What kind of computer protection software do I need?&rdquo; But figuring that out also requires a basic knowledge of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nortonlifelockpartner.com/security-center/computer-viruses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viruses</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nortonlifelockpartner.com/security-center/vulnerabilities.html">vulnerabilities</a>. There are many types of ways you and your computer can be attacked, and there are many types of programs that can help build up a proper defense.</p>
<h3>Firewalls</h3>
<p>Firewalls are one of the oldest types of Internet security software out there. Those who own a PC running Windows XP SP2 or newer already have a built-in, default firewall from Microsoft. Older or differing types of computers may need a unique firewall. A firewall simply attempts to control incoming and outgoing traffic between networks. There are two types: a hardware component, found in a router, and a software component. Both protect the network and prevent the spread of a virus within the network.</p>
<h3>Antivirus</h3>
<p>Antivirus software does what it sounds like; it seeks out and destroys viruses. Viruses are programs or bits of code that are loaded onto one's computer without the user knowing or wanting them. Because there are many types of viruses, computer virus protection software options became more and more complex over the years. These programs are utilities that hunt down issues on your hard disk and fix any that are found. They often have an auto-update capability, which enables them to stay up to date against current threats. They either have a dictionary of known issues that they hunt for or they monitor all programs and flag suspicious behavior.</p>
<h3>Anti-Spyware</h3>
<p>Spyware is different than viruses. Spyware is software that gathers your information (as though it is &ldquo;spying&rdquo; on you) through an Internet connection. Users often accidentally install spyware when trying to install some other free software. The program gathers information to sell back to advertisers, marketers, or other parties interested in your information. Thus, anti-spyware options are often separate options for computer protection software.</p>
<h3>Anti-Malware</h3>
<p><a href="https://www.nortonlifelockpartner.com/security-center/malware.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malware</a>, which is short for malicious software, is a broader term that may include everything from spyware to viruses to worms to Trojans. Anti-malware programs are all about finding the newest and latest threats and counteracting them. While an antivirus program is important, the best computer software protection comes from having a combination of both an antivirus and anti-malware program.</p>
<h3>Security Suites</h3>
<p>Some major names in computer software protection actually combine some of the above software types to create an all-in-one solution. This is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nortonlifelockpartner.com/security-center/how-norton-security-protects.html">how Norton Security protects its users</a>. A complex, frequently updated program of this kind can hunt spyware, malware, and viruses at once. It's a very wide umbrella with powerful results.</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Malware</span></h2>
<p>- Malware, short for <em>malicious software,</em> is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. We are going to explain these types of malware. It is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network." In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it. </p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;">Virus</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
<p>- A&nbsp;computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code. In the process, a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data.<p><strong>The signs of a computer virus are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequent pop-up windows.</strong>&nbsp;Pop-ups might encourage you to visit unusual sites. Or they might prod you to download antivirus or other software programs.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to your homepage.</strong>&nbsp;Your usual homepage may change to another website, for instance. Plus, you may be unable to reset it.</li>
<li><strong>Mass emails being sent from your email account.</strong>&nbsp;A criminal may take control of your account or send emails in your name from another infected computer.</li>
<li><strong>Frequent crashes.</strong>&nbsp;A virus can inflict major damage on your hard drive. This may cause your device to freeze or crash. It may also prevent your device from coming back on.</li>
<li><strong>Unusually slow computer performance.</strong>&nbsp;A sudden change of processing speed could signal that your computer has a virus.</li>
<li><strong>Unknown programs that start up when you turn on your computer.</strong>&nbsp;You may become aware of the unfamiliar program when you start your computer. Or you might notice it by checking your computer&rsquo;s list of active applications.</li>
<li><strong>Unusual activities like password changes.</strong>&nbsp;This could prevent you from logging into your computer.</li>
</ul></p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;">Worm</span></h3>
</li>
</ol>
A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage.

Worms can be transmitted via software vulnerabilities. Or computer worms could arrive as attachments in spam emails or instant messages (IMs). Once opened, these files could provide a link to a malicious website or automatically download the computer worm. Once it’s installed, the worm silently goes to work and infects the machine without the user’s knowledge.

Worms can modify and delete files, and they can even inject additional malicious software onto a computer. Sometimes a computer worm’s purpose is only to make copies of itself over and over — depleting system resources, such as hard drive space or bandwidth, by overloading a shared network. In addition to wreaking havoc on a computer’s resources, worms can also steal data, install a backdoor, and allow a hacker to gain control over a computer and its system settings

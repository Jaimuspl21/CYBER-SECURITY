<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Difference between passive and active security threats</span></h2>
<p>Active and Passive Attacks are security attacks. In Active attack, an attacker tries to modify the content of the messages. Whereas in Passive attack, an attacker observes the messages, copy them and may use them for malicious purposes.</p>
<p>Following are the important differences between Active Attack and Passive Attack.</p>

<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Malware</span></h2>
<p>- Malware, short for <em>malicious software,</em> is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. We are going to explain these types of malware. It is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network." In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Virus</span></span></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>- A&nbsp;computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code. In the process, a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data.<p><strong>The signs of a computer virus are:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Frequent pop-up windows.</strong>&nbsp;Pop-ups might encourage you to visit unusual sites. Or they might prod you to download antivirus or other software programs.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to your homepage.</strong>&nbsp;Your usual homepage may change to another website, for instance. Plus, you may be unable to reset it.</li>
<li><strong>Mass emails being sent from your email account.</strong>&nbsp;A criminal may take control of your account or send emails in your name from another infected computer.</li>
<li><strong>Frequent crashes.</strong>&nbsp;A virus can inflict major damage on your hard drive. This may cause your device to freeze or crash. It may also prevent your device from coming back on.</li>
<li><strong>Unusually slow computer performance.</strong>&nbsp;A sudden change of processing speed could signal that your computer has a virus.</li>
<li><strong>Unknown programs that start up when you turn on your computer.</strong>&nbsp;You may become aware of the unfamiliar program when you start your computer. Or you might notice it by checking your computer&rsquo;s list of active applications.</li>
<li><strong>Unusual activities like password changes.</strong>&nbsp;This could prevent you from logging into your computer.</li>
</ul></p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;">Worm</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage.

Worms can be transmitted via software vulnerabilities. Or computer worms could arrive as attachments in spam emails or instant messages (IMs). Once opened, these files could provide a link to a malicious website or automatically download the computer worm. Once it’s installed, the worm silently goes to work and infects the machine without the user’s knowledge.

Worms can modify and delete files, and they can even inject additional malicious software onto a computer. Sometimes a computer worm’s purpose is only to make copies of itself over and over — depleting system resources, such as hard drive space or bandwidth, by overloading a shared network. In addition to wreaking havoc on a computer’s resources, worms can also steal data, install a backdoor, and allow a hacker to gain control over a computer and its system settings
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;">Trojan</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems. Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Trojans are classified according to the type of actions that they can perform on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Backdoor&nbsp;</strong><br />A backdoor Trojan gives malicious users remote control over the infected computer. They enable the author to do anything they wish on the infected computer &ndash; including sending, receiving, launching and deleting files, displaying data and rebooting the computer. Backdoor Trojans are often used to unite a group of victim computers to form a botnet or zombie network that can be used for criminal purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploit&nbsp;</strong><br />Exploits are programs that contain data or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability within application software that&rsquo;s running on your computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rootkit&nbsp;</strong><br />Rootkits are designed to conceal certain objects or activities in your system. Often their main purpose is to prevent malicious programs being detected &ndash; in order to extend the period in which programs can run on an infected computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-Banker&nbsp;</strong><br />Trojan-Banker programs are designed to steal your account data for online banking systems, e-payment systems and credit or debit cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-DDoS&nbsp;</strong><br />These programs conduct DoS (Denial of Service) attacks against a targeted web address. By sending multiple requests &ndash; from your computer and several other infected computers &ndash; the attack can overwhelm the target address&hellip; leading to a denial of service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-Downloader</strong>&nbsp;<br />Trojan-Downloaders can download and install new versions of malicious programs onto your computer &ndash; including Trojans and adware.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-Dropper</strong>&nbsp;<br />These programs are used by hackers in order to install Trojans and / or viruses &ndash; or to prevent the detection of malicious programs. Not all antivirus programs are capable of scanning all of the components inside this type of Trojan.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-FakeAV</strong>&nbsp;<br />Trojan-FakeAV programs simulate the activity of antivirus software. They are designed to extort money from you &ndash; in return for the detection and removal of threats&hellip; even though the threats that they report are actually non-existent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-GameThief&nbsp;</strong><br />This type of program steals user account information from online gamers.</p>
</li>

<div class="rich-text-editor parbase section">
<p>Spyware is unwanted software that infiltrates your computing device, stealing your internet usage data and sensitive information. Spyware is classified as a type of malware &mdash; malicious software designed to gain access to or damage your computer, often without your knowledge. Spyware gathers your personal information and relays it to advertisers, data firms, or external users.</p>
</div>
<div class="rich-text-editor parbase section">
<p>Spyware is used for many purposes. Usually it aims to track and sell your internet usage data, capture your credit card or bank account information, or steal your personal identity. How? Spyware monitors your internet activity, tracking your login and password information, and spying on your sensitive information.</p>
<p>Some types of spyware can install additional software and change the settings on your device, so it&rsquo;s important to use secure passwords and keep your devices updated.</p>

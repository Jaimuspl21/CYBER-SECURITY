<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Malware</span></h2>
<p>- Malware, short for <em>malicious software,</em> is a blanket term for viruses, worms, trojans and other harmful computer programs hackers use to wreak destruction and gain access to sensitive information. We are going to explain these types of malware. It is a catch-all term to refer to any software designed to cause damage to a single computer, server, or computer network." In other words, software is identified as malware based on its intended use, rather than a particular technique or technology used to build it. </p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><strong><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Virus</span></span></strong></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>- A&nbsp;computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code. In the process, a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data.</p>
<img src="https://www.ceupe.com/images/easyblog_articles/2447/VIRUS.jpg" width="630"  height="300">
<p><strong>The signs of a computer virus are:</strong></p>
<li><strong>Frequent pop-up windows.</strong>&nbsp;Pop-ups might encourage you to visit unusual sites. Or they might prod you to download antivirus or other software programs.</li>
<li><strong>Changes to your homepage.</strong>&nbsp;Your usual homepage may change to another website, for instance. Plus, you may be unable to reset it.</li>
<li><strong>Mass emails being sent from your email account.</strong>&nbsp;A criminal may take control of your account or send emails in your name from another infected computer.</li>
<li><strong>Frequent crashes.</strong>&nbsp;A virus can inflict major damage on your hard drive. This may cause your device to freeze or crash. It may also prevent your device from coming back on.</li>
<li><strong>Unusually slow computer performance.</strong>&nbsp;A sudden change of processing speed could signal that your computer has a virus.</li>
<li><strong>Unknown programs that start up when you turn on your computer.</strong>&nbsp;You may become aware of the unfamiliar program when you start your computer. Or you might notice it by checking your computer&rsquo;s list of active applications.</li>
<li><strong>Unusual activities like password changes.</strong>&nbsp;This could prevent you from logging into your computer.</li>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;">Worm</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage.

Worms can be transmitted via software vulnerabilities. Or computer worms could arrive as attachments in spam emails or instant messages (IMs). Once opened, these files could provide a link to a malicious website or automatically download the computer worm. Once it’s installed, the worm silently goes to work and infects the machine without the user’s knowledge.

Worms can modify and delete files, and they can even inject additional malicious software onto a computer. Sometimes a computer worm’s purpose is only to make copies of itself over and over — depleting system resources, such as hard drive space or bandwidth, by overloading a shared network. In addition to wreaking havoc on a computer’s resources, worms can also steal data, install a backdoor, and allow a hacker to gain control over a computer and its system settings
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;">Trojan</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems. Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems. Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system.&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://incuatro.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/que-es-un-virus-troyano.jpg"  width="630"  height="330">
<p>Trojans are classified according to the type of actions that they can perform on your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Backdoor&nbsp;</strong><br />A backdoor Trojan gives malicious users remote control over the infected computer. They enable the author to do anything they wish on the infected computer &ndash; including sending, receiving, launching and deleting files, displaying data and rebooting the computer. Backdoor Trojans are often used to unite a group of victim computers to form a botnet or zombie network that can be used for criminal purposes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Exploit&nbsp;</strong><br />Exploits are programs that contain data or code that takes advantage of a vulnerability within application software that&rsquo;s running on your computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Rootkit&nbsp;</strong><br />Rootkits are designed to conceal certain objects or activities in your system. Often their main purpose is to prevent malicious programs being detected &ndash; in order to extend the period in which programs can run on an infected computer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-Banker&nbsp;</strong><br />Trojan-Banker programs are designed to steal your account data for online banking systems, e-payment systems and credit or debit cards.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-DDoS&nbsp;</strong><br />These programs conduct DoS (Denial of Service) attacks against a targeted web address. By sending multiple requests &ndash; from your computer and several other infected computers &ndash; the attack can overwhelm the target address&hellip; leading to a denial of service.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Trojan-Downloader</strong>&nbsp;<br />Trojan-Downloaders can download and install new versions of malicious programs onto your computer &ndash; including Trojans and adware.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Spyware</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<div class="rich-text-editor parbase section">
<p>Spyware is unwanted software that infiltrates your computing device, stealing your internet usage data and sensitive information. Spyware is classified as a type of malware &mdash; malicious software designed to gain access to or damage your computer, often without your knowledge. Spyware gathers your personal information and relays it to advertisers, data firms, or external users.</p>
</div>
<div class="rich-text-editor parbase section">
<p>Spyware is used for many purposes. Usually it aims to track and sell your internet usage data, capture your credit card or bank account information, or steal your personal identity. How? Spyware monitors your internet activity, tracking your login and password information, and spying on your sensitive information.</p>
<p>Some types of spyware can install additional software and change the settings on your device, so it&rsquo;s important to use secure passwords and keep your devices updated.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Types of hardware</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h4>1. RAM</h4>
<p>RAM (Random Access Memory) is a type of computer hardware that is used to store the information and then process that information. The processing speed of RAM is much faster than a hard disk but Ram is a volatile device which means when a computer system is shut down all the information stored is wiped out from RAM whereas hard disk is non-volatile which means it stores the data permanently in it. The data can be easily stored in RAM and can be easily fetched from RAM.</p>
<h4>2. Hard disk</h4>
<p>The hard disk is another type of computer hardware that is used to store the data in it. The hard disk can be preinstalled in CPU or can be used as an external device. The hard disk is the non-volatile component which means the data is stored permanently in hard disk and it does not wipe out when the system is shut down. The hard disk contains electromagnet surface which is used to store huge chunks of data and can be accessed easily. The hard disk has the capacity to store trillions of bytes of data in its storage. In the internal of hard disk, it has a collection of stacked disks which have electromagnetic surface used to store data in it.</p>
<h4>3. Monitor</h4>
<p>For the computer hardware, the hardware is another device that is used to display the output, videos and other graphics as it is directly connected to the CPU. The video displayed by the monitor uses the video card. The monitor can be compared to the television set but the difference is the resolution and graphics displayed by the monitor are of much high quality compare to the television set. The desktop is connected via a cable and gets fitted in a computer video card which is installed in the motherboard of the computer system. For laptops, tablets the monitor is pre-built in the system and there is no separate hardware installed in these devices. There are two types of computer monitors which are CRT and LCD.</p>
<h4>4. CPU</h4>
<p>CPU (Central processing unit) is the core hardware part of the computer system which is used to interpret and execute most of the commands using other computer parts i.e. software and hardware.&nbsp; The CPU is a core part of any PC, laptops, tablets, and notebooks. The CPU is also called the brain of the computer as every operation is executed in the CPU only. The CPU is made of computer chip which contains billions of small transistors installed on it. All the calculations are performed inside these transistors. The other hardware components which are monitor, keyboard, mouse, printer, sound system are connected o CPU.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Types of software</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many different types of Internet security software out there, and it can be a dizzying industry to a newcomer. New customers ask themselves, &ldquo;What kind of computer protection software do I need?&rdquo; But figuring that out also requires a basic knowledge of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nortonlifelockpartner.com/security-center/computer-viruses.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">viruses</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nortonlifelockpartner.com/security-center/vulnerabilities.html">vulnerabilities</a>. There are many types of ways you and your computer can be attacked, and there are many types of programs that can help build up a proper defense.</p>
<img src="https://www.incibe-cert.es/sites/default/files/styles/listado_315x180/public/contenidos/blog/antivirus.jpg?itok=PfhBxqDB" width="630" height="320">
<h4>Firewalls</h4>
<p>Firewalls are one of the oldest types of Internet security software out there. Those who own a PC running Windows XP SP2 or newer already have a built-in, default firewall from Microsoft. Older or differing types of computers may need a unique firewall. A firewall simply attempts to control incoming and outgoing traffic between networks. There are two types: a hardware component, found in a router, and a software component. Both protect the network and prevent the spread of a virus within the network.</p>
<h4>Antivirus</h4>
<p>Antivirus software does what it sounds like; it seeks out and destroys viruses. Viruses are programs or bits of code that are loaded onto one's computer without the user knowing or wanting them. Because there are many types of viruses, computer virus protection software options became more and more complex over the years. These programs are utilities that hunt down issues on your hard disk and fix any that are found. They often have an auto-update capability, which enables them to stay up to date against current threats. They either have a dictionary of known issues that they hunt for or they monitor all programs and flag suspicious behavior.</p>
<h4>Anti-Spyware</h4>
<p>Spyware is different than viruses. Spyware is software that gathers your information (as though it is &ldquo;spying&rdquo; on you) through an Internet connection. Users often accidentally install spyware when trying to install some other free software. The program gathers information to sell back to advertisers, marketers, or other parties interested in your information. Thus, anti-spyware options are often separate options for computer protection software.</p>
<h4>Anti-Malware</h4>
<p><a href="https://www.nortonlifelockpartner.com/security-center/malware.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Malware</a>, which is short for malicious software, is a broader term that may include everything from spyware to viruses to worms to Trojans. Anti-malware programs are all about finding the newest and latest threats and counteracting them. While an antivirus program is important, the best computer software protection comes from having a combination of both an antivirus and anti-malware program.</p>
<h4>Security Suites</h4>
<p>Some major names in computer software protection actually combine some of the above software types to create an all-in-one solution. This is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nortonlifelockpartner.com/security-center/how-norton-security-protects.html">how Norton Security protects its users</a>. A complex, frequently updated program of this kind can hunt spyware, malware, and viruses at once. It's a very wide umbrella with powerful results.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Network protocols</span></h2>
<p>A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network. Essentially, it allows connected devices to communicate with each other, regardless of any differences in their internal processes, structure or design. Network protocols are the reason you can easily communicate with people all over the world, and thus play a critical role in modern digital communications.</p>
<p>Similar to the way that speaking the same language simplifies communication between two people, network protocols make it possible for devices to interact with each other because of predetermined rules built into devices&rsquo; software and hardware.</p>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #ff6600;">SSL</span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h4 class="learning-content-h2 learning-content-h2--margin-top-16px">What is SSL?</h4>
<p>SSL, or Secure Sockets Layer, is an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-encryption/">encryption</a>-based Internet security&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/network-layer/what-is-a-protocol/">protocol</a>. It was first developed by Netscape in 1995 for the purpose of ensuring privacy, authentication, and data integrity in Internet communications. SSL is the predecessor to the modern&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/transport-layer-security-tls/">TLS</a>&nbsp;encryption used today.</p>
<p>A website that implements SSL/TLS has "<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-is-https/">HTTPS</a>" in its URL instead of "<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ddos/glossary/hypertext-transfer-protocol-http/">HTTP</a>."</p>
<p><a href="https://images.app.goo.gl/BqHZds8yExbcWpBG7"><img class="responsive-image" src="https://www.cloudflare.com/img/learning/security/glossary/what-is-ssl/http-vs-https.svg" alt="HTTP vs HTTPS" /></a></p>
<h4 class="learning-content-h2">How does SSL/TLS work?</h4>
<ul>
<li>In order to provide a high degree of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/privacy/what-is-data-privacy/">privacy</a>, SSL encrypts data that is transmitted across the web. This means that anyone who tries to intercept this data will only see a garbled mix of characters that is nearly impossible to decrypt.</li>
<li>SSL initiates an&nbsp;<strong>authentication</strong>&nbsp;process called a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/what-happens-in-a-tls-handshake/">handshake</a>&nbsp;between two communicating devices to ensure that both devices are really who they claim to be.</li>
<li>SSL also digitally signs data in order to provide&nbsp;<strong>data integrity</strong>, verifying that the data is not tampered with before reaching its intended recipient.</li>
</ul>
<p>There have been several iterations of SSL, each more secure than the last. In 1999 SSL was updated to become TLS.</p>
<h4 class="learning-content-h3">Why is SSL/TLS important?</h4>
<p>Originally, data on the Web was transmitted in plaintext that anyone could read if they intercepted the message. For example, if a consumer visited a shopping website, placed an order, and entered their credit card number on the website, that credit card number would travel across the Internet unconcealed.</p>
<p>SSL was created to correct this problem and protect user privacy. By encrypting any data that goes between a user and a web server, SSL ensures that anyone who intercepts the data can only see a scrambled mess of characters. The consumer's credit card number is now safe, only visible to the shopping website where they entered it.</p>
<p>SSL also stops certain kinds of cyber attacks: It authenticates web servers, which is important because attackers will often try to set up fake websites to trick users and steal data. It also prevents attackers from tampering with data in transit, like a tamper-proof seal on a medicine container.</p>   
<ul>

<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">HTTPS</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><span style="color: #000000;">What is HTTPS?</span></h4>
<p>Hypertext transfer protocol secure (HTTPS) is the secure version of HTTP, which is the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS is encrypted in order to increase security of data transfer. This is particularly important when users transmit sensitive data, such as by logging into a bank account, email service, or health insurance provider.</p>
<p>Any website, especially those that require login credentials, should use HTTPS. In modern web browsers such as Chrome, websites that do not use HTTPS are marked differently than those that are. Look for a green padlock in the URL bar to signify the webpage is secure. Web browsers take HTTPS seriously.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">IPv6</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>   
<h4>What is IPv6 and why is it important?</h4>
<p>IPv6 is the latest version of the Internet Protocol, which identifies devices across the internet so they can be located. Every device that uses the internet is identified through its own IP address in order for internet communication to work. In that respect, it&rsquo;s just like the street addresses and zip codes you need to know in order to mail a letter.</p>
<img src="https://images.idgesg.net/images/article/2017/11/ipv6newip-100740801-large.jpg" width="630"   height="330">
<p>The previous version, IPv4, uses a 32-bit addressing scheme to support 4.3 billion devices, which was thought to be enough. However, the growth of the internet, personal computers, smartphones and now Internet of Things devices proves that the world needed more addresses.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) recognized this 20 years ago. In 1998 it created IPv6, which instead uses 128-bit addressing to support approximately 340 trillion trillion (or 2 to the 128th power, if you like). Instead of the IPv4 address method of four sets of one- to three-digit numbers, IPv6 uses eight groups of four hexadecimal digits, separated by colons.</p>
<h4>What are the benefits of IPv6?</h4>
<p>In its work, the IETF included enhancements to IPv6 compared with IPv4. The IPv6 protocol can handle packets more efficiently, improve performance and increase security. It enables internet service providers to reduce the size of their routing tables by making them more hierarchical.</p>

<h2 style="text-align: center;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Digital certificates and certificate authorities</strong></span></h2>  
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Digital certificates</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>   
<h4><strong>What is a digital certificate?</strong></h4>
<p>A&nbsp;Digital Certificate&nbsp;is an electronic "password" that allows a person, organizaion to exchange data securely over the Internet using the public key infrastructure (PKI). Digital Certificate is also known as a&nbsp;public key certificate&nbsp;or&nbsp;identity certificate.</p>
<img src="https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Digital-Certificates.png" width="630"  height="320">
<p>There are three main types of digital certificates used on the internet to authenticate web servers and web browsers:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Domain Validated (DV SSL) certificates</strong>: Popular among smaller businesses and website owners, a DV SSL certificate demonstrates that its holder has the right to use the associated domain name, but they don&rsquo;t guarantee who the holder of the certificate is.</li>
<li><strong>Organization Validated (OV SSL) certificates</strong>: As the name suggests, an OV SSL certificate provides assurances about the holder of the certificate, giving businesses the opportunity to build trust with their customers.</li>
<li><strong>Extended Validation (EV SSL) certificates</strong>: Conforming to the X.509 standard, an EV SSL certificate proves the legal entity of the owner. It is signed by a Certificate Authority key that can issue EV certificates. EV SSL certificates are used by e-commerce websites, governments, and businesses and organizations in highly regulated industries.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Benefits of Using a Digital Certificate</h4>
<p>Certificate-based authentication offers many benefits that make it an essential part of any modern cybersecurity strategy. The benefits include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Integrity</strong>: With digital certificates, it&rsquo;s not possible to intentionally or unintentionally tamper with the message en route because any such attempt would be instantly discovered.</li>
<li><strong>Confidentiality</strong>: Digital certificates solve what has arguably become the biggest problem of the internet&mdash;the fact that it was not designed with privacy in mind&mdash;by allowing two parties to communicate privately across a public network.</li>
<li><strong>Identification</strong>: Digital certificates clearly identify the communicating parties and prove that they are really who they present themselves to be.</li>
</ul>   
<ul>
<li>
<h3><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="color: #ff6600; text-decoration: underline;">Certificate authorities</span></span></h3>
</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>What is a certificate authorities?</strong></h4>
<p>Certificate Authorities, or Certificate Authorities / CAs, issue Digital Certificates. Digital Certificates are verifiable small data files that contain identity credentials to help websites, people, and devices represent their authentic online identity (authentic because the CA has verified the identity). CAs play a critical role in how the Internet operates and how transparent, trusted transactions can take place online. CAs issue millions of Digital Certificates each year, and these certificates are used to protect information, encrypt billions of transactions, and enable secure communication.</p>
